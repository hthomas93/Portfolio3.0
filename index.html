                I am transitioning into a career as a web developer. I have a degree in English from UT Austin and have a background in management and customer service. I discovered the joys of programming several years ago and am now working my way through a web development bootcamp.

            <p>
                My hobbies include watching and discussing films with my friends, discovering new and exciting music, running, and boxing. I am a native Texan and have lived in Austin for the last eight years. I'm a Scorpio!
